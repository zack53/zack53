Software developer that graduated from UMGC in 2019. My major was in in Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity. Currently working at IBM since graduation as a Data Integration Developer. I am passionate about blockchain technologies and have taught myself solidity. I have created MVPs for two projects. The first is the [Crypto Arbitrage Bot](https://github.com/zack53Crypto-Arbitrage-Price-Bot) where I have implemented an Aave v3 Flash Loan and deployed to the Polygon Mainnet. 

I have also created a MVP for a [NFT loan platform](https://github.com/zack53/nftys-defi). The MVP is very barebones for the front-end, but the smart contracts have been tested with 53 different tests that I have written using JavaScript. There should be more tests written before this would be used on the Mainnet. To be specific, I would like to add more negative tests and interest calculation tests. I believe we would need to add in the openzeppelin ReentrancyGuard to the code as well for safety.
